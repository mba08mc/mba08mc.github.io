About this site:
<br>
I initially created this site in 2022 on github as a place to host my Cydia repository, which ended up only having like 2 packages on it. So in 2024 I expanded the site, (and bought the altnet domain), aiming to make it a homepage for those with PowerPC Macs running MacOSX as there is very little support for them online. The website was never finished and layed dormant for a year til now, Dec 31 2025. The site will be finished and expanded, containing software archives, support and other related things for not only PPC Macs, but Intel OS X(10.4-10.6 for now), early iPhoneOS (My repository is specifically for iPhoneOS 2), and possibly Xbox 360s if I get around to that. The site is completely static and as of now all resources are hosted locally so link rot shouldn't be an issue. All custom images were created in I think Photoshop CS3 i forgot. This website is built to support basically every old browser, so it shouldnt matter what system your running.
